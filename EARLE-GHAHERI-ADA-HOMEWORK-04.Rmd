## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## The standard error for the original lm are 0.67293 and 0.08488 respectively. The standard error for the bootstrap model are 0.06746 and 0.00869. Each value for the bootstrap model is a roughly 10th of the former model.

## The confidence interval for the bootstrap model is very close to the values for the original lm.
